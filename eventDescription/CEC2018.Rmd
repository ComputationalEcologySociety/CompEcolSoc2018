# Computational Ecology Conference

Computational ecology is now a full blown, [emerging science](http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/2/241), and the time is ripe for a conference gathering the young and innovative minds currently dedicating their research acumen to the development of this exciting field. For students, by students, the event will offer an experience allowing participants to share in a variety of ways through a mix between educational workshops, expert panel discussions, conferences and interactive coding sessions.

Over a full week of activities in the beautiful city of Montreal, participants will first be invited to participate to educational workshops. Beginners will have the opportunity to participate to a full two day [Software Carpenty](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop, while more advanced participants will be able to choose from a selection of [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) workshops and special topics in advanced R programming. The following two days will be dedicated to conferences, poster sessions, expert panels and code sprints. Finally the last day will be dedicated to a multi-hour hack'a'thon and networking time.
